# Bike Sharing Analysis

In this project, I explored bike riding data throughout New York City. I looked at things like time out on a ride, sex of the person, city hotspots, and much more. Before I began this analysis, I had to make sure to convert the tripduration column in my csv file from an integer into a datetime datatype with the help of Pandas library and Python. From there, I was able to easily access the time element through Tableau to help create more visualizations. The code I used to perform this conversion is linked above in the NYC_CitiBike_Challenge.ipynb file.
