# Bike Sharing Analysis

In this project, I explored bike riding data throughout the city. I looked at things like time out on a ride, sex of the person, and city hotspots. Before I began this analysis, I had to make sure to convert the tripduration column from an integer into a datetime datatype with the help of pandas and Python. From there, I was able to easily access the time element through Tableau to help create more visualizations. The code I used to perform this conversion is linked above in the NYC_CitiBike_Challenge.ipynb
